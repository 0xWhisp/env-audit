# Coding Standards

## Code Style
- Write minimal code - less is better
- Avoid verbose implementations
- No over-engineering - solve the problem, nothing more
- Keep functions small and focused

## Quality
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Follow Go idioms and conventions
- Efficient code over clever code

## Security
- Never log or expose sensitive values
- Validate all inputs
- Use secure defaults
- Handle errors explicitly

## Git Commits
- Short, human commit messages
- Present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- One logical change per commit
- Example: "Add empty value detection"
