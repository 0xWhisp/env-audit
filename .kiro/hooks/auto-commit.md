# Auto Commit Hook

After completing a task, commit all changes with a short, human commit message.

## Instructions
1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Commit with a tiny, casual message - like texting a friend
3. Max 5-6 words, no fluff

Examples:
- "init project"
- "add empty check"
- "fix parser bug"
- "wire up cli"
